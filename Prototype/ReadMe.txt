Rob, I decided to change the layout of the main page a bit. The ice cream scoops separating the “Today`s Flavors” of the Ingredients section was not looking good for the desktop version. Was huge comparing to the other visual elements. So I decided to remove it. From my point of view, it’s looking a lot better and cleaner.

The ice cream cone in the main section is my own photography work (I’m a product photographer). The ice cream pot was a mockup I did. All other images are listed bellow:
